# Learn Playwright

This repository contains automated tests written using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).
Playwright is considered one of the best solutions for end-to-end (E2E) testing due to the following key features:

- **Cross-Browser Testing**:
  Playwright supports all major browsers, including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. This ensures your application works seamlessly across different environments.

- **Automatic Waiting**:
  Playwright automatically waits for elements to be ready before performing actions, reducing the need for complex and flaky manual wait logic.

- **Multi-Language Support**:
  While built in Node.js, Playwright offers bindings for Python, Java, and C#, making it accessible to developers across different tech stacks.

- **Fast and Reliable**:
  Playwright runs tests quickly and efficiently, with parallel execution and reduced flakiness, even for dynamic web applications.

- **Headless and Headed Execution**:
  Tests can be run in headless mode for CI pipelines or headed mode for debugging and observation.
